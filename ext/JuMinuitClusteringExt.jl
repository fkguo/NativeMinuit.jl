# JuMinuitClusteringExt — DBSCAN backend for multi-modal solution detection.
#
# Activated automatically when the user has `using Clustering` loaded
# alongside `using JuMinuit`. Provides the concrete method for the
# `_dbscan_labels` stub declared in `src/solution_modes.jl`, enabling
# `find_solution_modes(samples, m; method=:dbscan)`.
#
# Why a package extension: Clustering.jl pulls in Distances, NearestNeighbors,
# StatsBase, and more — a non-trivial transitive load. The built-in
# single-linkage connected-components clusterer (`method=:components`) covers
# the common case with ZERO dependencies; DBSCAN is the optional, density-based
# upgrade for arbitrary cluster shapes + explicit outlier handling. Julia 1.9+
# `[weakdeps]` + `[extensions]` is the standard idiom for this "optional
# algorithm backend" pattern — mirrors `JuMinuitForwardDiffExt`.
#
# Whitening note: the points handed to DBSCAN here are ALREADY whitened
# (Mahalanobis or per-σ) by `find_solution_modes`, so the radius is in σ units
# and the plain Euclidean metric Clustering uses is the correct distance — see
# the `src/solution_modes.jl` header for why the whitening is mandatory.

    JuMinuit._dbscan_labels(Z, radius, min_neighbors, min_cluster_size) -> Vector{Int}

DBSCAN backend (Clustering.jl) for [`JuMinuit.find_solution_modes`](@ref) with
`method=:dbscan`.

`Z` is the WHITENED sample matrix (`d × N`, columns = points) produced by
`find_solution_modes`; because it is already whitened, `radius` is a distance in
σ units and the default Euclidean metric is the statistically correct one.
`min_neighbors` is the DBSCAN core-point density (a point needs this many
neighbors within `radius` to seed a cluster); `min_cluster_size` drops clusters
smaller than this as noise.

Returns a length-`N` label vector, `0 = noise`, surviving clusters labelled
`1, 2, …` (re-packed dense). `find_solution_modes` then orders them by χ².
